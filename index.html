      <p>Hi my name is Hayden, I grew up in Seattle, WA. I lived in Texas for one year of my life and decided it wasnt for me.
        After which i moved back to Washington where i finished out high school and started to grow in the field of construction, took a break from that and went into fabrication then continued to move on into Mortgages.
        I decided to reinvest in myself and abilities and dive head first into coding. So far im enjoying it. I love playing games on all devices, like AC Valhalla on pc or smash bros on Switch.
        I also love to do muy thai as a great workout and self defense.
        You'll find me with my fiance and two dogs most days.
